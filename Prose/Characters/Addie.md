# Addie

### Personal History

Addie was raised in what became the capital, at the heart of the new revolution.  Her father, like his father and grandfather before him, was a blacksmith.  She grew up believing she could never take after him, but the advent of common alchemy changed all that.  She enrolled in the local college as soon as it opened its doors.

### Personal Vignettes

(Addie)

> I remember, at the end of my second year there, I made a sword.  It was beautiful- steel, with gold and silver inlay in a dragon pattern.  Took me about a week, most of that spent on the art.
>
> I took it home to show my father.  I had completed my apprenticeship!  I thought he would be ecstatic!  But he didn't believe me.  I'm still not sure what it was- maybe he thought I couldn't be strong enough to do the work, maybe he just thought metalworking couldn't be learned that quickly.  I guess he didn't realize how much time I'd spent looking over his shoulder.
>
> What could I do?  I got it out, and I showed it to him.  I told him I'd made for my exam, that everyone had made one like it but how proud I was of the designs.
>
> He was furious.  I was so focused on my own achievement that I couldn't see why, and I didn't handle it well.  I accused him of all sorts of things- like that he didn't want me to succeed, or that he was jealous of my vision, or a thousand other things.
>
> Of course that was all insane.  We were never wealthy, but he'd paid for my schooling, hadn't he?  He must have wanted me to be there.
>
> Later, I spoke to my mother about the fight.  She told me that he had once made a sword like that, as his masterwork.  It had taken him almost a year, and the materials' cost alone had nearly bankrupted them.
>
> He wasn't mad at what I had done, he had just realized how worthless his skills had become.  A lifetime of experience, highly specialized skill, generations of tradition and secret techniques couldn't compete with an eager child and a bit of training.

(Addie)

> It wasn't just being shown up, though.  It was happening all around the city, and I suspect it was happening all over the country.  I got a job in one of the new big shops, making cans- I guess food keeps longer if you seal it up.
>
> That was something my father could never have done.  Can you imagine?  Making a thin, delicate shell of metal, just to hold food for a while and then be thrown away?  All with fire and a hammer?
>
> *\*laughs\**
>
> No, I wasn't a competitor to him.  But a lot of folks were.  People like to point to weapons and armor when they think of a blacksmith, but his real livelihood was in horseshoes and wagon wheels, and that was where they were killing him.  It took him the better part of an afternoon to shoe a horse- now one man could make hundreds in a day, and sell them for nothing.

### Professional Role


Addie is the "smith" of the settlement.  She is in charge of producing anything from horseshoes to plows to weapons and armor- anything that needs to be made from metal.

Addie was trained in the capitol, and that training included both traditional blacksmithing techniques (heated metal, etc.) as well as a small amount of alchemy.  Her particular flavor of alchemy consists transmutation of metals into other metals.  This is used not only to grant access to otherwise rare metals, but also in the creation or repair process itself- transmuting hard steel to soft gold makes forming the shape that much easier.
