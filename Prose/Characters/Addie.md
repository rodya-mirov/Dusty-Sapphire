# Addie

----

### Personal History

Addie was raised in Roslim, at the heart of the new revolution.  Her father, like his father and grandfather before him, was a blacksmith.  She grew up believing she could never take after him, but the advent of common alchemy changed all that.  She enrolled in the local college as soon as it opened its doors.

With graduation, she got a job in a factory making cans for Targin Manufacture, which was somewhere between interesting (because of the new technology involved) and horribly boring (because cans).  Relationship with family suffered, as she was part of the industry which was destroying her father's livelihood.

She became aware of some of Targin's less ethical moments, specifically their untrained blood magic labor force.  The workers were largely poor and uneducated, and she felt it was an abuse of those who desparately needed work.  She confronted her manager about it and was immediately fired.

In response, she attempted to destroy a storehouse of these mass-produced goods at night.  They caught wind of the plan before she enacted it and cornered her in an unused warehouse.  After a failed attempt to escape using the bomb, she received (and accepted) the Call.

With divine help, she escaped and was healed by an anonymous doctor friendly to the cause.  She fled the city to a village in the country, where her tattoos made her unwelcome but her skills made her useful.

When the resettlement initiative began, a Roslim military officer found her and offered her amnesty in exchange for joining the initiative to (specific town).  She initially refused, but under threat of immediate arrest and execution, she accepted the suddenly quite reasonable deal.

### Professional Role


Addie is the "smith" of the settlement.  She is in charge of producing anything from horseshoes to plows to weapons and armor- anything that needs to be made from metal.

Addie was trained in the capitol, and that training included both traditional blacksmithing techniques (heated metal, etc.) as well as a small amount of alchemy.  Her particular flavor of alchemy is metallurgy- temporarily softening or hardening metals for a variety of purposes.  Using blood magic, she can even liquify metal temporarily, although she does not use this technique during her professional role.

### Personal Vignettes

(Addie, apprentice project)

> I remember, at the end of my second year there, I made a sword.  It was beautiful- steel, with gold and silver inlay in a dragon pattern.  Took me about a week, most of that spent on the art.
>
> I took it home to show my father.  I had completed my apprenticeship!  I thought he would be ecstatic!  But he didn't believe me.  I'm still not sure what it was- maybe he thought I couldn't be strong enough to do the work, maybe he just thought metalworking couldn't be learned that quickly.  I guess he didn't realize how much time I'd spent looking over his shoulder.
>
> What could I do?  I got it out, and I showed it to him.  I told him I'd made for my exam, that everyone had made one like it but how proud I was of the designs.
>
> He was furious.  I was so focused on my own achievement that I couldn't see why, and I didn't handle it well.  I accused him of all sorts of things- like that he didn't want me to succeed, or that he was jealous of my vision, or a thousand other things.
>
> Of course that was all insane.  We were never wealthy, but he'd paid for my schooling, hadn't he?  He must have wanted me to be there.
>
> Later, I spoke to my mother about the fight.  She told me that he had once made a sword like that, as his masterwork.  It had taken him almost a year, and the materials' cost alone had nearly bankrupted them.
>
> He wasn't mad at what I had done, he had just realized how worthless his skills had become.  A lifetime of experience, highly specialized skill, generations of tradition and secret techniques couldn't compete with an eager child and a bit of training.

(Addie, father's business situation)

> It wasn't just being shown up, though.  It was happening all around the city, and I suspect it was happening all over the country.  I got a job in one of the new big shops, making cans- I guess food keeps longer if you seal it up.
>
> That was something my father could never have done.  Can you imagine?  Making a thin, delicate shell of metal, just to hold food for a while and then be thrown away?  All with fire and a hammer?
>
> *\*laughs\**
>
> No, I wasn't a competitor to him.  But a lot of folks were.  People like to point to weapons and armor when they think of a blacksmith, but his real livelihood was in horseshoes and wagon wheels, and that was where they were killing him.  It took him the better part of an afternoon to shoe a horse- now one man could make hundreds in a day, and sell them for nothing.
>
> What could he do?

(Addie, the Call)

> "Let me help you."
>
> I remember those words more vividly than anything else in my life.  I could feel the words, more than hear them, and I could feel what they meant.  To accept that offer was to give up everything I am.
>
> I trusted that voice, to a point anyway.  Trust fueled by desparation, maybe.  There was a promise in those words.  A promise that it was on my side, that it wouldn't ruin me.  That it would leave me, not broken and compromised, but better than before.
>
> "Let me help you."
>
> So I said yes.

(Addie, aftermath of the Call)

> Then it took control.  Not in a hostile way- I could tell that at any moment, I could take that control back.  But I could also tell that was absolutely not a good idea.
>
> When it started, I had my back to the wall, my pulse racing, panicked.  I was bleeding from the explosion and the bones in my left arm had been completely shattered.  I could barely think.  So it that way it was calming for it to take over- I didn't have to deal, anymore.  I could just watch and hope it could figure a way out of here.
>
> It turns out my brokenness was exactly the tool of my salvation.  Aether was flooding out of me, almost palpable in the air.  Of course I had heard of blood magic, but I'd never expected to be near it.  It was a nightmare, something in the outer fringes, not here, not in the capital.
>
> Armored men were standing at the exit, swords drawn, blocking my escape.  Another advanced on me.  No need for him to rush- I was wounded.  Trapped.  Scared.
>
> The Spirit launched me into a run, charging directly at him.  He raised his sword and I caught it with my hand, liquifying it as it cut into me.  I didn't stop running.  The men at the door were too surprised to move.  Their eyes widened, and as I brushed past them, their armor fell apart, bits of it in useless puddles on the floor.
>
> They didn't bother to follow me.

(Addie, aftermath of the Call, part II)

> After I got out of that building, the rest was easy.  It guided me through a maze of other buildings, and eventually to a section of the outer wall.  I climbed over it, slowly, with my one working arm.  I never saw another guard.
>
> When I got out of the complex, I could wander more freely, and the guidance felt a little less forceful.  I felt tugs at street corners and eventually into a doorway.  I walked in without knocking.
>
> The voice was gentle, yet forceful as always.  "Do not be afraid."
>
> Then it left me, and leaning only on my own strength, I collapsed.  I woke up in a strange bed, covered in bandages, with feeling already returning to my arm.  There was a note beside me.
>
> *You'll be fine.  It's been two days.  Don't go home.  Get out of town.*
