Feris
===

> *It is autumn.  The house, once quite grand, has fallen into disrepair.  Sections of the wall are rotted through, and many roof tiles are missing.  Few of the windows have any glass left in them.*
>
> *All around the house lie fields, half plowed.  Despite the season, there are no plants to be seen.  The soil is parched, and dust blows freely with the wind.  A young Feris sits on the edge of the porch, staring vacantly at the abandoned town in the distance.*
>
> *A well-dressed man approaches along the road. As he nears the house, Feris stands and hops to the ground.*
>
> Man: "Hello."
>
> *Feris watches him without responding.*
>
> Man: "My name is Ademain Roth, from the Bank of Roslim.  Is Veran here?"
>
> Feris: "Left last year."
>
> Man: "Unfortunate.  However, as you may be aware, he owes us quite a bit of money.  I understand this farm had a rough couple of years."
>
> *Feris sweeps his arm, pointing across the empty field.*
>
> Man: "Indeed.  Then considering the amount of the debt and the impossibility of payment, the Bank of Roslim will take ownership of the land and house in lieu of payment.  Please vacate our property immediately."
>
> *Feris takes a step forward, suddenly engaged.*
>
> Feris: "This land is worthless!  That's why you don't have your money!  What are you possibly going to do with it?"
>
> Man: "I don't know.  It's at the discretion of the owner which, again, is the Bank."
>
> Feris: "So you're just going to kick me out of my house?"
>
> *Ademain takes a few steps back and lifts his hands in surrender.*
>
> Feris: "You have *nothing* to gain!"
>
> Ademain: "Sir, this business was done between the Bank and the previous owner of this house, who I must assume is your father.  I have no interest either way in this matter.  Please, calm down."
>
> *Feris lashes out with his fist, knocking the man on his back.*
>
> Feris: "Of course!  No need to get upset!"
>
> *As the man attempts to roll over and stand up, Feris kicks him hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.*
>
> Feris: "I was born in this house!"
>
> *A gasp escapes the man's mouth, trying and failing to find words.*
>
> Feris: "You've already taken everything worth taking!"
>
> Man: "No ... please stop ..."
>
> *Another sharp kick and there is a wet snap.  A rib is broken.*
>
> Feris: "Everything you have, you stole from people like me!"
>
> *The man starts to curl up, and Feris flips him back over.*
>
> Feris: "Look in my eyes!  Face your accuser!"
>
> *The man's eyes are wide with terror and his mouth lies open.  He has stopped trying to speak.  Feris crouches next to him and watches for a moment.  Then his hands lash out, smashing the banker's jaw.  Feris' hands grab hard onto his neck, squeezing the air out.*
>
> *After a few minutes, there is no more life left to extinguish.  But he does not let go for a long time.*
