Magic and Aether
===
---

Magic, historically, was the art of manipulating a mysterious power known as Aether for any of a great variety of effects.  Recent experiments have demystified Aether somewhat, allowing for general use of it, and a subsequent rapid development in technology.

Overview
---
Aether acts a bit like a background radiation.  While its original source is unknown, it exists in very small (almost negligible) quantities all across the world.  Some materials - in particular, organic tissue - have a natural "capacity" for holding Aether, and slowly absorb the surrounding trace amounts as they approach saturation.

In this way, living things act like slow-charging batteries.  The trick, it turns out, is using that charge (ideally without damaging the "battery" when you do).

Passive Aether
---

Aether exists everywhere, but tends (like most forms of energy) toward a kind of equillibrium.  In particular, all materials have a certain capacity for holding Aether, and that Aether flows from more saturated objects to less saturated objects, eventually tending toward even saturation.

Thus, in general, Aether net flow is zero.  The typical way of inducing Aether flow is to affect capacity.  Increasing capacity of an object (by whatever means) creates a positive net flow into that object, whereas decreasing capacity causes negative net flow.

Aether Capacity
---
Aether capacity of a material (or coherent object) is somewhat difficult to predict, but seems correlated with the amount of "structure" on that object.  For example, a large crystal, being highly structured throughout, has a large capacity.  If that same crystal were shattered, the total capacity of the resulting dust would be much less than the original crystal, since the structure now only exists at a much smaller level.

Living tissue, particularly that of animals, and more particularly that of humans, is among the most potent of Aether capacitors, but only when it is in good working order.  A reduction in Aetheric capacity often indicates some sort of systemic health problem, though it can also be the result of certain types of injuries.  In humans, it seems most tied to the blood, so a broken arm would not affect capacity, but blood loss (or disease) would.

Aether capacity can be increased by adding certain types of structure to an object.  While the science behind this is still in its infancy, many traditional ideas such as tattoos can permanently increase the Aetheric capacity in a person (or animal).  Similarly, certain gestures or incantations (even certain ways of walking or holding ones' self) can temporarily increase capacity, until the action is stopped.

Active Aether
---

Air is known to have a certain water capacity (depending on temperature, etc.), and should the total contained water ever rise above that point, the water will suddenly change from invisible vapor to physical water (as dew or precipitation).

In much the same way, if an object achieves Aetheric saturation above 100%, the excess Aether becomes "active" and can be interacted with directly.  Depending on the amount, this can have wild and intense effects, or be barely noticeable.  Either way, without direction, it quickly disperses toward equilibrium, and becomes passive once more when the saturation drops back below capacity.

Creating active Aether is referred to as "discharging" it (since it removes the "charge" of an object).

Common Methods of Discharging Aether
---

The most common and simplest way to discharge Aether is to reduce the capacity of the host material.  Since objects' capacity is in some sense a result of their structure, this process typically involves some kind of destruction.

The most common, and frequently most potent, capacitor for Aether is living tissue.  Therefore, the easiest way to discharge a large quantity of active Aether is to convert living tissue into dead tissue.

Note that this is frequently undesirable for the capacitor.

Historically, this process has manifested in the pagan rituals of human or animal sacrifice.  Even without the sophisticated directing technology we now possess, they were able to (with significant loss of life) produce quite intense effects, which have become legendary in the retelling.

This does not have to kill the host, of course.  Damage to a human body is still enough of a loss of structure to discharge some Aether, roughly in proportion to the damage.  This has led to the later practice of blood magic.  While not as immediately impressive as human sacrifice, this allows the caster to discharge his or her own power without fatality.

It has also led to the somewhat horrifying practice of keeping a population of slaves, acting as passive harvesters of ambient Aether, then bleeding them to power whatever magic the blood mage intended.  This is of course illegal (as of fifteen years ago) and the practice has been stamped out entirely.

It is slanderous to compare this to the methods of the Tegrun Manufacturing Company, whose laborers are well compensated for their time as well as any damage they may sustain in our factories.

Finally, and most arcanely, certain rituals can temporarily increase the Aetheric capacity of an individual.  These rituals typically involve highly structured incantations and gestures, intended to raise the stored energy of the person above their passive carrying capacity (and thus reduce their saturation, creating an inward flow of Aether).  At the conclusion of the ritual, their capacity will return to normal, and the resulting overload will activate.

These rituals are often performed in highly structured spaces, as are frequently associated with mages and wizards of all kinds.  These spaces frequently include painted patterns on the floor, walls, or ceiling, as well as high capacity inert objects (like crystals) and sometimes strange architecture, all of whose intent is to put more Aether near the ritual, and thus speed up the charging process.

In any case, at the conclusion of these rituals, the capacity will result to normal.  The more Aether that was absorbed during the ritual, the more will be discharged at its conclusion (and quickly reabsorbed by the surrounding area, if not quickly directed and harnessed).
