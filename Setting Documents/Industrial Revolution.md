Magic Industrial Revolution
=======

_"Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from technology."_

The world is in the middle of a magical industrial revolution.  Magic, once considered to be an unpredictable and uncontrollable power, has been subjected to the same empiricism as other physical laws.  What was once the domain of a secretive cabal of wizards can now be used for any number of completely common purposes.

Traditional ways of life have been completely disintegrated in a few years.  Generations of practicing and perfecting a craft became irrelevant.  Regardless of quality, the old ways are just _too slow_, and ruinously inefficient.
